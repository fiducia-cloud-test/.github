# `fiducia-cloud-test` organization defaults

This public `.github` repository is the canonical home for shared community-health files, organization profile content, contribution guidance, security reporting, agent policy, and repository-boundary notes.

## Durable engineering policy

- This repository defines public organization-wide defaults for `fiducia-cloud-test`.
- Never commit credentials, private keys, access tokens, customer data, or private-repository inventories.
- Resolve Git conflicts semantically: inspect both sides, the merge base, nearby tests and contracts, and normally 3–10 relevant prior commits. Never blindly select all of `ours` or all of `theirs`.
- Prefer focused pull requests, explicit validation, non-destructive Git operations, and documented tradeoffs.
- Cross-repository integration uses versioned interfaces, APIs, SDKs, events, or explicitly owned replicated read models. Services do not reach into another service's database by default.
- `*-infra` repositories and `*-monorepo` application source remain separate. A `*-infra` repository must never appear as a Git submodule under `*-monorepo/apps`.
- Git submodules are reserved for explicitly coordinated editable source composition. Zed packages or immutable artifacts are preferred for package dependencies. Production deploys immutable artifacts or OCI digests, not source clones.

## Inheritance note

GitHub can inherit supported community-health files from this repository when a target repository does not define its own version. Workflows, branch protections, rulesets, repository settings, and arbitrary documentation are not inherited automatically.

## Organization-wide defaults

This public repository is the canonical source for GitHub-supported community-health fallbacks, organization profile content, contribution guidance, public security/support policy, issue and pull-request templates, and agent-governance declarations for [`fiducia-cloud-test`](https://github.com/fiducia-cloud-test).

## Safety baseline

All Git conflicts must be resolved semantically with full historical, repository-wide, organization-wide, and relevant external-organization context. Automated agents are hard-denied from destructive or history-rewriting operations, including all forms of `git stash`, `git reset`, `git clean`, `git filter-repo`, force pushing, destructive deletion, data or infrastructure teardown, credential revocation, and policy bypass.

## GitHub inheritance boundary

GitHub can use supported community-health files from a public organization `.github` repository as fallbacks and can render `profile/README.md` on the organization page. `agents.md`, `AGENTS.md`, Copilot instructions, workflows, settings, rulesets, branch protections, permissions, and secrets are not automatically inherited merely because they exist here. Each repository must carry or synchronize compatible local policy and explicitly call reusable workflows where enforcement is required.
